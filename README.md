# AutoDriving_Decision_DeepReinforcementLearning

By using Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL), we have made a model that can train auto-driving decisions. The input to the model is a three-lane model in a high-speed scene. After sensing the surrounding environment, the output of our model is: 1ï¼‰The left/right lane changing command and 2) change to the middle of which two cars.
